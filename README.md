#Chemistry Solver
Chemistry Solver is a collection of tools that assist in solving chemistry problems found in a general or basic chemistry course. The tools are robust, modular, and are light-weight. To get a better idea of what tools are provided and how they work, take a look at the project's website [here](https://hoshiningen.github.io/chemistry-solver/overview/).

### How to Install
Fork the repository and clone it to your machine. Chemistry Solver was written in C#, and was developed in Visual Studio. Double click the solution file to import the project into Visual Studio, which will then let you build it.
